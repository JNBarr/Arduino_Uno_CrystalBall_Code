# Arduino_Uno_CrystalBall_Code
Code complies and will verify fine within the arduino IDE. I had a problem with my circuitboard arrangement and couldn't get the LCD display to work correctly. Happy Holidays!

Note: File is saved as a TXT so just copy and paste it into your text editor. Arduino circuits use c++ so .cpp should be fine if you're importing it.
